## Summary
Spot-check of 13 llm-evals audit reports covering 64 sampled verified claims across UI navigation, backend endpoints, data schemas, and feature behavior. Two partial failures detected: (1) leaderboard.md claims the sidebar menu item is listed but visible inspection shows it is commented out in the source code (EvalsSidebar.tsx:137-139), and (2) models.md claim about Settings tab configuration is only partially verified—backend storage confirmed but Settings UI interaction requires additional visual verification. Remaining 62 claims (96.9%) verified successfully against codebase evidence.
