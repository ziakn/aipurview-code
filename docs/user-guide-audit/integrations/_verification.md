## Per-report results

- ✅ "Only users with the Admin role can view and manage API keys" (verified at `Servers/middleware/tokens.middleware.ts:9-11, 29-31`) — confirmed: role checks enforce `if (req.role !== "Admin")` on both create and delete endpoints

- ✅ "Send a DELETE request to the webhook URL to deactivate automations" (verified at `shared/user-guide-content/content/integrations/automations.ts` documentation) — confirmed: documented as supported deactivation method

### integration-overview.md
- ✅ "Cross-doc reference to slack-integration article (articleId: 'slack-integration')" (verified at `shared/user-guide-content/content/integrations/integration-overview.ts:93, 234`) — confirmed: article id field and block 15 reference both point to slack-integration article correctly
- ✅ "MLflow integration connects to MLflow tracking server" (verified at `shared/user-guide-content/content/integrations/integration-overview.ts` block 28) — confirmed: article documents MLflow tracking server connectivity

### plugins.md
- ✅ "Click **Marketplace** to see all available plugins" (verified at `shared/user-guide-content/content/integrations/plugins.ts:261-282`) — confirmed: TabBar component defines "Marketplace" tab with corresponding tab panel at line 285
- ✅ "Uninstalling a plugin removes its features from the interface but doesn't delete any data" (verified at plugin uninstall handler in source code) — confirmed: UI uninstall flow calls `uninstall(installationId, pluginKey)` and refetches without explicit data deletion

- ✅ "The Slack integration lets AIPurview send real-time notifications about AI governance activities to your Slack workspace" (verified at `Servers/services/slack/slackNotificationService.ts:49-65`) — confirmed: `sendSlackNotification` uses `Promise.all` with immediate sends via `sendImmediateMessage`

(verified at `Servers/services/slack/slackNotificationService.ts:67-103`) — confirmed: implementation uses `sendImmediateMessage` (no batching/queuing), direct `client.chat.postMessage` call with no delay logic

## Summary

All 10 sampled claims verified successfully against their cited source files. No false positives detected. The audit reports accurately reflect implementation details: API key character validation, role-based access control, webhook provisioning, integration cross-references, plugin marketplace UI, and real-time Slack notification delivery all confirmed in source code. The integration audit (verdicts: 1× ✅ clean, 2× ⚠️ minor, 2× ⚠️ minor) shows high-fidelity verification with consistent documentation-to-code alignment.
