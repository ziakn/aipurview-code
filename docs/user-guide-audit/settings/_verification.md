**Reports spot-checked:** 5
**Claims re-verified:** 10
**Failed spot-checks:** 3

## Per-report results

### notifications.md
- ✅ Claim: "Only admins can configure the Slack integration" — Verified at `Clients/src/application/repository/slack.integration.repository.ts` (admin context enforcement confirmed)
- ⚠️ Claim: "AIPurview can notify you about various governance events: Model updates, Risk assessments, Compliance changes..." — **False positive**: NotificationType enum at `Servers/domain.layer/interfaces/i.notification.ts:5–60` defines 28 concrete types (TASK_ASSIGNED, POLICY_DUE_SOON, TRAINING_ASSIGNED, VENDOR_REVIEW_DUE, etc.) but NOT "MODEL_UPDATED", "RISK_ASSESSMENT", or "COMPLIANCE_CHANGE". Abstract categories do not align with actual code implementation.

### organization-settings.md
- ❌ Claim: "The organization name must be between 2 and 100 characters" — **FAILED**: Code enforces 2–50 characters max. Verified at `Clients/src/domain/models/Common/organization/organization.model.ts:35` which returns error "Organization name must be less than 50 characters".
- ❌ Claim: "Only users with Admin or Editor roles can modify organization settings" — **FAILED**: Code restricts edit to Admin only. Verified at `Clients/src/application/constants/permissions.ts:27–31` which defines `organizations: { edit: ["Admin"] }`. Editors can view but not edit.

### role-configuration.md
- ✅ Claim: "AIPurview has four predefined roles: Admin, Reviewer, Editor, Auditor" — Verified at `Clients/src/application/constants/roles.ts:1–6` (ROLES enum defines Admin=1, Reviewer=2, Editor=3, Auditor=4; Super Admin=5 is separate)
- ✅ Claim: "Admins have full control over the platform" — Verified via permissions constants and API key restrictions requiring Admin role in `Clients/src/application/constants/permissions.ts`

### super-admin.md
- ✅ Claim: "User invite step: Choose a role: Admin, Reviewer, Editor or Auditor" — Verified at `Clients/src/application/constants/roles.ts:10–15` (ROLE_OPTIONS constant explicitly excludes Super Admin)
- ✅ Claim: "Super admin users have Full access to all organizations" — Verified in `Clients/src/application/constants/roles.ts` (Super Admin role 5 defined with no restrictions in permission constants)

### user-management.md
- ✅ Claim: "Settings page has 6 tabs: Profile, Password, Team, Organization, Preferences, API keys" — Structure verified in article; no code contradictions found
- ❌ Claim: "The user's assigned role (Admin, Reviewer, Editor or Auditor)" — **FAILED**: Missing Super Admin from role enumeration. Code ROLES enum at `Clients/src/application/constants/roles.ts:1–6` includes role 5 "Super Admin", but article lists only four roles in team table and invite modal.

## Summary
Three material false-positives identified across the settings collection: (1) organization-settings reports Editor access to org edits but code restricts to Admin only, (2) organization-settings documents 100-character limit but enforces 50-character max (100% overstatement), and (3) user-management omits Super Admin from role lists despite it existing in ROLES enum. notifications.md uses abstract governance categories not aligned with the 28 concrete NotificationType enum values in code. role-configuration.md and super-admin.md reports are accurate; all verified claims match code behavior.
