The K-S statistic is the largest gap between the two empirical cumulative distribution functions. A statistic of 0.0 means the distributions are identical; 1.0 means they are completely disjoint. The reported p-value uses the standard Kolmogorov asymptotic formula and tells you how surprising that gap would be under the null hypothesis that both samples come from the same distribution.',
