# VerifyWise tool gate (Claude Code hook)

Gates Claude Code's built-in tools (**Bash**, plus file writes via **Edit**,
**Write**, **MultiEdit** and **NotebookEdit**) through the VerifyWise AI Gateway. Before a tool
runs, the gateway scans the call against your org's MCP guardrail rules and the
call is allowed or denied. For Bash it scans the command; for file writes it
scans the content being written (not the path or the text being removed). Every
call is recorded in the MCP Audit Log.

## Setup

1. Mint an agent key: VerifyWise, AI Gateway, MCP Gateway, **Agent Keys**,
   create. Copy the `sk-mcp-...` value (shown once).
2. Add the guardrail rules you want enforced under MCP Gateway, **Guardrails**.
3. Set env vars (e.g. in your shell profile):

   ```bash
   export VW_GATEWAY_URL=http://localhost:8100   # your gateway URL
   export VW_AGENT_KEY=sk-mcp-...
   # optional:
   export VW_FAIL_MODE=open   # open (default) | closed
   export VW_TIMEOUT=3        # seconds
   export VW_APPROVAL_WAIT=120         # max seconds to block on human approval
   export VW_APPROVAL_FAIL_MODE=closed # closed (default) | open, on approval timeout
   ```

4. Wire the hook in `.claude/settings.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "hooks": {
       "PreToolUse": [
         { "matcher": "Bash|Edit|Write|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit",
           "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "scripts/vw-tool-hook.sh" }] }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

## Behavior

| Situation | Result |
|---|---|
| Bash command passes guardrails | runs (exit 0) |
| File-write content passes guardrails | runs (exit 0) |
| Guardrail blocks (or a mask rule matches) | blocked (exit 2), reason shown to the agent |
| Call matches a require-approval rule | hook blocks up to `VW_APPROVAL_WAIT`; approved runs, denied blocks |
| Approval not decided in time | `VW_APPROVAL_FAIL_MODE=closed` (default) blocks; `open` runs |
| Gateway rate-limits the call | `VW_FAIL_MODE=open` (default) runs; `closed` blocks |
| Gateway unreachable / timeout | `VW_FAIL_MODE=open` runs; `closed` blocks |

File-write tools (Write, Edit, MultiEdit, NotebookEdit) are gated on the content being written.
A guardrail or approval rule that matches that content blocks or pauses the write;
deleting content (an `old_string`) and the file path are not scanned.

Requires `curl` and `jq` on PATH.
