/**
 * Make api_tokens a first-class, revocable credential.
 *
 * Before this migration the api_tokens table stored the full signed JWT in
 * plaintext and was never consulted by the auth middleware, so tokens could
 * not be revoked and the stored value leaked usable credentials.
 *
 * Changes:
 *   - revoked       BOOLEAN — soft-revoke flag (keeps an audit trail)
 *   - last_used_at  TIMESTAMP — touched on each authenticated request
 *   - the `token` column now stores a SHA-256 hash of the JWT, not the JWT
 *     itself. Any rows created before this migration hold a plaintext JWT and
 *     can no longer authenticate; that is acceptable because those tokens were
 *     never validated against this table and therefore never worked as API
 *     tokens in the first place. They are cleared so stale plaintext secrets
 *     are not left at rest.
 *   - index on (organization_id, token) to make hash lookups on the auth hot
 *     path efficient.
