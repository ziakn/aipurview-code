/**
 * File-time handler for `agent_create_risk`.
 *
 * Called by the LLM via the tool bridge whenever the model decides to
 * propose a new risk. This function does NOT create the risk — it:
 *
 *   1. Strict-validates the LLM's params against `AgentCreateRiskSchema`.
 *   2. Opens a transaction and ensures the per-tenant "AI Action Approval"
 *      workflow exists.
 *   3. Inserts an `approval_request` row with entity_type='ai_action' and
 *      an `entity_data` payload that the generic executor in
 *      `aiActions/executor.ts` will pick up after approval.
 *   4. Returns a `pending_approval` status that the LLM uses to craft its
 *      user-facing reply ("I've filed an approval request, go to Pending
 *      Approvals...").
 *
 * Moved from `Servers/advisor/functions/riskFunctions.ts` during the
 * aiActions reorganization. No logic changes beyond the import paths and
 * the renamed local preview function.
