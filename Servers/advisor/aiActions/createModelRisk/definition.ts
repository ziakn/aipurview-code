      "Propose creating a new MODEL-specific risk attached to an AI model (or unattached for later linking). Use this WHEN THE USER EXPLICITLY ASKS to create a model risk (e.g. 'add a model risk for X', 'log a security risk on the GPT-4 model', or supplies a concrete risk_name + any of description/risk_category/risk_level/owner/target_date/mitigation_plan/impact/likelihood alongside a model). This is a WRITE action — it does NOT execute immediately. Instead, it files an approval request that appears in the dedicated Pending Approvals page (a human Admin must approve before the risk is actually created).\n\nSAME-TURN-AS-MODEL-CREATION USAGE (CRITICAL): If the user asks for both a model AND an explicit risk in the same message (e.g. 'create model X with risk Y' or 'register model X and a risk for it with risk_name=...'), you MUST call this tool in the SAME TURN as agent_register_model. Pass pending_model_approval_id=<approvalRequestId returned by agent_register_model> and OMIT model_id. This is the dedicated mechanism for same-turn parent+child filing — DO NOT defer the risk to a later turn, and DO NOT skip this tool. The suggested-risk inline cards from agent_suggest_model_risk are NOT a substitute for the user's explicit risk — that risk has user-supplied parameters and must route to Pending Approvals via THIS tool.\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT use this tool when the suggest_risks_for_model flow asks you to file generated/suggested risks — for that flow use agent_suggest_model_risk (which creates inline chat-card approvals). Use THIS tool only for risks the USER explicitly described.\n\nIMPORTANT — collecting required fields:\n1. Use this tool when the user explicitly asks to create, add, or log a new model risk OR supplies explicit risk parameters alongside a model.\n2. Parse the user's prompt for every field below. Do NOT invent values the user did not give.\n3. For owner: if the user mentions a person by name, call list_users first to resolve the numeric id. Do NOT pass a name string.\n4. For model_id: resolve via fetch_model_inventories if the user mentions a model name. Omit if the user wants the risk unattached. If the model is being registered in this same turn, use pending_model_approval_id INSTEAD of model_id.\n5. Once you have all the user's stated info, call this tool exactly once. Then tell the user to open Pending Approvals to approve or reject.",
