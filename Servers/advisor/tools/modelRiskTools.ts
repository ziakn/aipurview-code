Same-turn-as-model-registration (most common): right after agent_register_model returns an approvalRequestId, file 3–5 of these in the same turn — each one references the still-pending model approval via `pending_model_approval_id`. The user approves the model first in Pending Approvals, then approves any of the inline risk cards. If they approve a risk before the model, the executor errors with 'approve the model first'.\n\n2. Post-approval (user already has an existing model): pass `model_id` directly.\n\nCRITICAL: risk_category MUST be EXACTLY one of these 5 strings (case- and word-sensitive — copy verbatim): \"Performance\" | \"Bias & Fairness\" | \"Security\" | \"Data Quality\" | \"Compliance\". DO NOT pass any other value (no \"Geopolitical\", no \"Vendor Lock-in\", no \"Operational\" — those are NOT valid). The reasoning dimensions below are for choosing WHICH risks to file; you map every chosen risk into one of those 5 enum buckets.\n\nDimension → category mapping examples:\n  - Data sovereignty / cross-border transfer / export controls / state-access exposure → Compliance\n  - Vendor lock-in / ToS retention / IP leakage on prompts → Compliance (or Security if data-confidentiality framed)\n  - Jailbreak / harmful-content generation / agentic blast radius → Security\n  - Hallucination / output unpredictability / model drift → Performance\n  - Biased / discriminatory outputs / training-data representation → Bias & Fairness\n  - Training-data opacity / dataset quality / labelling errors → Data Quality\n  - EU AI Act Art. 50 transparency / GPAI obligations / ISO 42001 controls triggered → Compliance\n\nReasoning dimensions (use to PICK the 3–5 most material risks; do NOT pass these strings as risk_category):\n  - Provider country / jurisdiction (data sovereignty, export controls, state-access). China-headquartered providers carry export-control + censorship-shaped-output exposure; US providers carry CLOUD-Act exposure for non-US data; EU providers carry the lowest cross-border friction for EU customers.\n  - Provider company posture (vendor lock-in, training-data opacity, ToS privacy stance, model-deprecation cadence, IP-leakage on prompts).\n  - Hosting model (SaaS API → network egress + vendor downtime; self-hosted open-weight → supply-chain on weights; on-prem → compliance ownership).\n  - Capabilities & modality (jailbreak/misuse, hallucination, harmful-content generation; agentic → automated-action blast radius).\n  - Compliance frameworks the org is subject to (EU AI Act, ISO 42001, ISO 27001, NIST AI RMF).\n\nFor user-explicit 'create a model risk' requests, use agent_create_model_risk instead (that routes to the Pending Approvals page rather than inline cards).",
